    "\n",
    "If I had to summarize how I would approach the task differently next time, I would start by deciding early what the narrow focus of the analysis is going to be. \n",
    "Making these decisions early would have allowed me to eliminate a greater number of columns and rows from the start, even before applying any programming  techniques to the overall dataframe. \n",
    "This would probably save a tremendous amount of time and angst. \n",
    "\n",
    "I realize how much there is still to learn on the best ways to manipulate the data part of your dataframe and, now I understand better what was meant by \"Do not take notes!\" since  writing the correct programming instructions can really depend on the specific case and, google (and pandas libraries, among other resources!) are always available to lend a hand. \n",
